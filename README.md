This Android application implements a smart library management system to streamline book issuance, eliminate the need for costly scanners, and reduce human errors. By recognizing students via face recognition and books via barcode, the app simplifies the borrowing process. The app is developed using Android Java and includes three machine learning (ML) modules built with Python, which are integrated via a Flask app providing specific API endpoints.
